# Run a GPT4All model locally

Yes! ChatGPT-like powers on your PC, no internet and no expensive GPU required! 

Here it's running inside of NeoVim:

And here is how it runs on my machine (low quality GIF):

# Try it yourself

Here's how to get started with the CPU quantized GPT4All model checkpoint:

0. Make sure you have Zig master installed. Download from [here](https://ziglang.org/download/)
1. **Optional:** Download the `gpt4all-lora-quantized.bin` file from [Direct Link](https://the-eye.eu/public/AI/models/nomic-ai/gpt4all/gpt4all-lora-quantized.bin) or [[Torrent-Magnet]](https://tinyurl.com/gpt4all-lora-quantized).
2. Clone or download this repository
3. Compile with `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast`
4. Run with `./zig-out/bin/chat`

If you didn't download the model yourself, the download of the model is
performed automatically:

```shell
$ ./zig-out/bin/chat 
Model File does not exist, downloading model from: https://the-eye.eu/public/AI/models/nomic-ai/gpt4all/gpt4all-lora-quantized.bin
Downloaded:   19 MB / 4017 MB   [  0%]
```

If you downloaded the model yourself and saved in a different location, start with:

```shell
$ ./zig-out/bin/chat -m /path/to/model.bin
```

**In case of errors on Windows**: Check out / download the branch `no-curl`.
This has the model download feature removed, that came with lots of
dependencies. I haven't tested this code on Windows yet.

**Please note**: This work merely adds a `build.zig` and the automatic model
download to the excellent work done by Nomic.ai:
- [GPT4All](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all): Everything GPT4All
- [gpt4all.cpp](https://github.com/zanussbaum/gpt4all.cpp): Source code of the
  chat client


## How to use other models like gpt4all-lora-unfiltered

Check out [GPT4All](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all) for other compatible
models. Use the following parameters:

- `-m model_filename` : the model file to load.
- `-u model_file_url` : the url for downloading above model if auto-download is
  desired.

## Where to take it from here

This code can serve as a starting point for zig applications with built-in LLM
capabilities. I merely added the `build.zig` to the existing C and C++ chat code
provided by [gpt4all.cpp](https://github.com/zanussbaum/gpt4all.cpp), and added
the auto model download feature.

From here,

- write leightweight zig bindings to load a model, based on the C++ code in
  `cpp_main()`.
- write leightweight zig bindings to provide a prompt and context, etc. to the
  model and run inference, probably with callbacks.

## Linux and Mac only?

Also, so far I have only tested this on Linux and macOS. Would be interesting to
know if modifications are required for Windows. If so, the answers
will all be `Makefile` of gpt4all.cpp ðŸ˜Š.


## Closing remarks

I was unable to use the binary chat clients provided by GPT4All on my NixOS box:

```
gpt4all-lora-quantized-linux-x86: error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++.so.6: cannot open shared ob ject file: No such file or directory
```

That was expected on NixOS, with dynamically linked executables. So I had to run
`make` to create the executable for my system, which worked flawlessy. Congrats
to Nomic.ai! 

But with the idea of writing my own chat client in zig at some time in the
future in mind, I began writing a `build.zig`. I really think that the
simplicity of it speaks for itself. 

The only difficulty I encountered was needing to specify
`D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=199309` for `clock_gettime()` to work with zig's built-in
clang on my machine.
